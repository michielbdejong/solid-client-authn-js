# Solid JavaScript Authentication - solid-client-authn

`solid-client-authn` is a set of libraries designed to authenticate with Solid identity servers.
The libraries share a common API and include different modules for different deployment environments:

- `solid-client-authn-browser` can be used to help build web apps in the browser.
- `solid-client-authn-node` is **planned** to help build server-side and console-based apps.

@inrupt/solid-client-authn libraries are part of a family open source JavaScript libraries designed to support developers building Solid applications.

# Inrupt Solid JavaScript Client Libraries

## Data access and permissions management - solid-client

[@inrupt/solid-client](https://docs.inrupt.com/client-libraries/solid-client-js/) allows developers to access data and manage permissions on data stored in Solid Pods.

## Authentication - solid-client-authn

[@inrupt/solid-client-authn](https://github.com/inrupt/solid-client-authn) allows developers to authenticate against a Solid server. This is necessary when the resources on your Pod are not public.

## Vocabularies and interoperability - solid-common-vocab-rdf

[@inrupt/solid-common-vocab-rdf](https://github.com/inrupt/solid-common-vocab-rdf) allows developers to build interoperable apps by reusing well-known vocabularies. These libraries provide vocabularies available as constants that you just have to import.

# Authentication libraries

The different `solid-client-authn` libraries all share the same interface ([see API reference](https://docs.inrupt.com/client-libraries/api/javascript/solid-client-authn-browser/)). `solid-client-authn` includes two APIs for building applications: a "Single Session API" and a "Multi Session API".

## Usage

### Single session API

`solid-client-authn`'s single session API is designed to provide a streamlined experience when implementing authentication in apps that focus on just one user.
You'd use the single session API to:

- Create a single page web application that only one user logs into at a time.
- Make a bot that only represents one user.
- Build a mobile application that only one user logs into at a time.

#### Examples

- [Single-session the web browser with your own bundler](examples/single/bundle)

### Multi Session API

`solid-client-authn`'s "Multi Session API" allows you to manage multiple sessions for multiple logged in users at the same time. You'd use the multi session API to:

- Create a web application with a server side component. While one user may be logged into each individual client, the server will need to manage all logged in users.
- Make a bot that needs to operation on behalf of multiple users.
- You have a single page application, but you want to maintain credentials on the server for security.
- You want to log in multiple identities for either a single human user, or multiple users.

### Setting up the examples

```bash
git clone https://github.com/inrupt/solid-client-authn.git
cd solid-client-authn
npm ci
npm run bootstrap-examples
# Run each example from the root
## single session API, bundler mode
cd examples/single/bundle
npm run start
## single session API, script mode
cd examples/single/script
npm run start
```

At this point, a test application will be running on port `3001`.
Be sure that you enter a valid Solid issuer before logging in
, for example: `https://identity.demo-ess.inrupt.com`.
